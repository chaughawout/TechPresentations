## Who Am I Even
Corbin Haughawout. **Full-Stack Engineer** on **GAPCIE** at **Northrop Grumman**.

Been officially *in* industry since January. Been developing applications since *2013*.

Spreading the gospel of **Functional Programming** and sharing my disappointment of **JavaScript frameworks**.


## Let's Talk JavaScript & JavaScript Frameworks
#### Pros:
- Doesn't get in your way
- Multi-paradigm
- Easily Share applications over the internet & web pages
- Everyone uses it

#### Cons:
- No compilation step
- Runtime Exceptions abound!
- No Module System
- Spaghetti **EVERYWHERE**

### Frameworks
#### Angular 1.X
Model View Controller, Two Way Data-binding (watchers), Expressions in HTML Markup, JavaScript, (soon to be deprecated)

#### Angular 2
Component Based, Opt-in Two Way Data-binding, Expressions in HTML Markeup, JavaScript, Backed by Google (but not really...)

#### ReactJS
Not a Structural Framework, Update App Model, Fast, Gaining Popularity

#### Aurelian
Uses Web-Components, Opt-in Two-Way Data-binding, JavaScript, Dog-fooded by their dev team

#### Ember
Uses Web-Components, Difficult to Optimize, Dog-fooded by their dev team

#### And more...


## Let's Talk Functional Programming & Elm

Elm is a functional language for Application Development.
Compiles to JavaScript.
Derivative of Haskell without all the complicated stuff.
Faster than any front-end framework on the market (according to official benchmarks from the framework).
Active and friendly community!

### Positive Technical Details of Elm
Time tracking debugging - Simplifying Q&A
Data is always immutable.
Elm-Architecture is familiar to Ruby on Rails MVC.
Compiler Messages are **USEFUL**
Built for JavaScript Interop
Can be introduced slowly into existing baseline!

### Cons of Using Elm
Learning Curve.
Not backed by large companies.
Possibly development time?
Young framework leads to often having to build out the components yourself.

## Questions before Code?

Now's a good time to ask any questions you may have before we dig into the official examples!

**Let's See the Code!**
Please, don't be afraid to ask questions if you have them during this part. I'll try my best to answer them while also explaining the code we are reading.
