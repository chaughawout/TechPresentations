## Let's Talk Functional Programming & **Elm**

Elm is a functional language for Application Development.
Compiles to JavaScript.
Derivative of Haskell without all the complicated stuff.
Faster than any front-end framework on the market (according to official benchmarks from the framework).
Active and friendly community!

### Positive Technical Details of Elm
Time tracking debugging - Simplifying Q&A
Data is always immutable.
Elm-Architecture is familiar to Ruby on Rails MVC.
Compiler Messages are **USEFUL**
Built for JavaScript Interop
Can be introduced slowly into existing baseline!

### Cons of Using Elm
Learning Curve.
Not backed by large companies.
Possibly development time?
Young framework leads to often having to build out the components yourself.

## Questions before Code?

Now's a good time to ask any questions you may have before we dig into the official examples!

**Let's See the Code!**
Please, don't be afraid to ask questions if you have them during this part. I'll try my best to answer them while also explaining the code we are reading.
